Exploiting Opportunistic Observations with Seasonal Site Use Models (Daily Occupancy Models)
=======================================================================================================================
Supplementary data and scripts

This repository accompanies the text: Ruete et al. 2017. Exploiting Opportunistic Observations to Estimate Changes in Seasonal Site Use: An Example with Wetland Birds. JX X:XX-XX

Here you can download all data and scripts needed to replicate the analyses done in the article. 
To run it you will need to install R <http://www.r-project.org/> and JAGS <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/>.

### NOTE: 
To run these scripts you will need at least 16GB of RAM, and the code is written so that models are fitted in 4 independent chains, therefore you will need at least 4 cores (you can change that if you want, though).
Be warned, model fitting takes about 2 hours per species (CPU i7 @3.5Ghz).
